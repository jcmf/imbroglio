#start

This is the first passage in the game.  From here you could go
[[left]] or [[right->To the Right]].

#left

You went left!  There isn't much here.

# To the Right

You went right!  Wow, this is boring.
You have been here #{@count or= 0; ++@count}
time#{if @count is 1 then '' else 's'}.
Go [[start<-back]] maybe?
