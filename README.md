# imbroglio

a tool for making browser-based interactive fiction

## Hold on!  What is this "interactive fiction" of which you speak?

Like, in general?  That's just a fancy name people use for text
adventure games for your computer, where you read a description of
what is happening and then maybe type stuff or click on stuff and
see what happens next.  Like Infocom's Zork, back in the 1980s,
when PCs were this new thing and were pretty much incapable of
displaying pictures.  Choose Your Own Adventure books might be
another good example from around the same era -- or maybe those
totally don't count at all, depending on who you ask!  Like didn't
I just say computers?  It's not just one thing, it's like several
related things.  Sometimes people argue about it, or write dissertations
about it, or whatever.  You know how people get sometimes.

## Okay that's nice but what is this imbroglio thing for, specifically?

Oh!  It's for making a particular style of game that *I* happen to
want to make right now.  I mean maybe it'll turn out to be a *bit*
more general, but I hope it won't get too general for its own good.

Some of the basic ideas are:

* lives on a web page, runs in a web browser;

* player reads a paragraph or three, followed by some multiple-choice
style options; player chooses an option, gets some more text, and so on,
until the game ends;

* you make choices by clicking on them, or else by typing the letter
or number that appears before or within the thing you want to choose,
or possibly by typing in a few words;

* you can always scroll back and review the full transcript of the
game so far;

* while scrolling back you can change your mind and rewind the game
to any given point and retroactively choose something else, pretty much just
by clicking on it;

* the page URL just ends with all the letters and/or numbers of all
the choices you've made, which *completely* determine everything
else you see in the game, so you can undo a rewind with the Back
button, or use your browser history to go back to what you had an
hour ago, or save by bookmarking, or send someone the URL so they
can see the full transcript of what you did, or close your browser
and pick up again later without having to jump through hoops;

* looks nice -- decent fonts, real quotes, real dashes, enough white
space to read by, works on tiny phones -- you know, the basics;

* doesn't need a server or a network connection to play;

* creating a new game is almost as easy as playing one -- do it
right there in the browser, start typing stuff and immediately see
it working, even offline, save it to an `.html` file right on your
computer, do whatever you want with it.

## Ideas, huh?  I take it this thing doesn't actually exist yet?

Yes, that is 100% correct, at least as I write this.  It'll probably
remain mostly correct for quite some time, too.  I'll try to remember
to remove this bit when it stops being true, though.

## So, um.  How can I put this gently.  Have you heard of a thing called Twine?

[Of course.](http://twinery.org/)

## So... let me guess: you think Twine is terrible?

Not at all!  Twine is fantastic.

## Then I don't even have to explain why you're an idiot for even wanting to make this new thing that is strikingly similar to that existing established thing, because you already know that, right?

Yep!

## Don't you feel bad, though, for making the world a worse place by trying to add yet another similar-but-worse thing instead of contributing to this existing good thing?

Nope.

## Come on, man.  Work with me, here.  I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from.  Couldn't you just... what's the... where is the point in... why do you... why are... why?

`*shrug*`

## You're really not helping your case here.  Why would anyone even want to use your thing?

Beats me.  People do weird things sometimes.

## Wait so uh whose thing is this and what am I allowed to do with it?
